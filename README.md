Our design solution allows users to access a mobile app that notifies the user of the current equipment’s availability in the gym. In order to present this information, the mobile app updates via manual input of equipment usage. Users can then check the app to decide when to go to the gym based on the availability of their specific workout equipment as well as the best order to use the equipment while there. Our solution helps optimize the users’ time while allowing a greater number of people to access the gym efficiently, reducing waiting time for all users.
